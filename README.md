**Step 1: Install the Environment**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where the homework code is located.
   - Execute the following command to install the required dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt` file:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

**Step 2: Run the Application**
